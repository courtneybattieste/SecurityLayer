# SecurityLayer
A reference monitor that maintains a backup copy of a file in the case that it is written to incorrectly. It also comes with attack cases. This was a project that I was able to complete in my CS-UY 3923 Computer Security class. More information about this project can be found at https://github.com/SeattleTestbed/docs/blob/master/EducationalAssignments/ABStoragePartOne.md
