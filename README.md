# SecurityLayer
A reference monitor that maintains a backup copy of a file in the case that it is written to incorrectly. It also comes with attack cases. This was a project that I was able to complete in my CS-UY 3923 Computer Security class. More information about the reference monitor can be found in the Project Description.

Note: The github repositories that this project came from may change over time, therefore the requirements found at the linked repositories might be different from the project displayed here.
